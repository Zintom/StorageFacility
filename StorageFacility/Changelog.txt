1.3*:
Fixed bug where RAWs would not have a newline after them in the output file.
Added option for outputOptimizedForReading on the StorageEditor, setting this to true will enable new-lines in the output file.

1.2*:
Added the RAW data type; used for storing byte arrays(byte[]);
What sets this Type apart from the others is that it is "Length Prefixed" rather than "Null Terminated", the first of its kind.
